This is a vignette intended to introduce new users to `clinvaR` ([https://github.com/jamesdiao/clinvaR](https://github.com/jamesdiao/clinvaR)). 

## Purpose
For `clinvaR`, the first goal is to go from genes to a vcf of related variants, along with classifications from any version of ClinVar.  
This involves 3 steps:  

1. Select a list of genes that you are interested in. clinvaR makes it easy to download and import relevant variants from 1KG.  
2. Select a version of ClinVar to assign pathogenicity labels with. All previous ClinVar VCFs are stored as binary files and can be retrieved with a "closest date" function.  
3. Select an analysis method. These include frequency and submission count over time, and aggregate frequency by ancestral group.  

## Dependencies

clinvaR has a number of file dependencies that are generally useful for these types of projects. I have attached them here. `remotes` and `devtools` are interchangeable. 
```{r, echo = F}
pkg_list <- c("remotes","pander","ggplot2","tibble","tidyr","dplyr", "stringr")
installed <- installed.packages()[,"Package"]
is.installed <- pkg_list %in% installed
if (!all(is.installed))
  install.packages(pkg_list[!is.installed])
print(names(sapply(pkg_list, require, character.only = T)), quote = F)
if (!("clinvaR" %in% installed))
  remotes::install_github('jamesdiao/clinvaR')
require(clinvaR)
```


## Select a List of Genes

The first step is to have a list of genes that you are interested in. 

### Method 1: Direct assignment
The easiest way is to directly save your genes of interest in gene_panel as a character vector (all caps). We have taken the example of the 20 genes on the Laboratory of Molecular Medicine's gene testing panel for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 


```{r}
hcm_panel <- c("ACTC1", "ACTN2", "CSRP3", "GLA", "LAMP2", "MYBPC3", "MYH7", 
"MYL2", "MYL3", "MYOZ2", "NEXN", "PLN", "PRKAG2", "PTPN11", "RAF1", 
"TNNC1", "TNNI3", "TNNT2", "TPM1", "TTR")
```

### Method 2: Import from text file

#### From own file
Another way is to save your gene list in a text file (1 gene per line) and import it. 

```{r}
path <- system.file("extdata/MacArthur_Gene_Lists/lists/lmm_hcm.tsv", package = "clinvaR")
print(path)
hcm_panel <- get_genes(path)
print(hcm_panel)
```

#### From clinvaR stored lists
The MacArthur Lab has assembled a compilation of gene lists ([https://github.com/macarthur-lab/gene_lists](https://github.com/macarthur-lab/gene_lists)) that may be a useful starting point. We have included all sets (and a few of our own) with abbreviated descriptions. Please visit the GitHub repo for citation information.

These are easily imported using `get_genes()` by directly referring to the file name. Use the `get_genes()` command without arguments to list possibilities. 

```{r}
get_genes()
hcm_panel <- get_genes('lmm_hcm.tsv')
print(hcm_panel)
```

The last way is to search OMIM for related genes. This has not been added as a full feature yet. 

```{r, echo = F, include = F}
#omim_table <- read.table('clinvaR/storage/gene_lists/other_data/omim.full.tsv', 
#                         sep = '\t', fill = T, header = T)
#search_terms <- c("Cardiomyopathy")
```

## Download and Import 1000 Genomes VCF

```{r}
#hcm_download_log <- download_1000g(genes = hcm_panel)
vcf <- import_file_1000g(genes = hcm_panel)
vcf[1:3,1:8]
```

Note that there are another 2504+ columns, including individual-level data (0 = homozygous reference, 1 = heterozygous, 2 = homozygous alternate). 

## Import ClinVar VCF

This must be annotated with some version of ClinVar. This can be done either using the latest saved version (July 5, 2017), or by specifying a date from the list. 

```{r}
get_date_list()
```

Use `get_clinvar()` to collect from a certain date (if date is not present, the closest date is used). 

```{r}
newest_clinvar <- get_clinvar(Sys.Date())
newest_clinvar[1:4,] #%>% select(-VAR_ID, -CLNDBN)
```

## Annotate Gene-Variant VCF

The ClinVar VCF can be used to annotate the Gene-Variant VCF. Note that this removes all variants without pathogenic assertions. 

```{r, cache = T}
hcm_vcf <- annotate_1000g(vcf = vcf, clinvar = newest_clinvar, conflicts = TRUE)
mybpc3_vcf[1:3,1:12]
```

If we wanted to do this in fewer lines of code (with all the defaults used above), we could have done this more quickly by simply specifying the genes in annotate. We can also specify whether we want to exclude the (likely) pathogenic variants with any (likely) benign conflicts as well. These are included by default. 

## Simple Analyses

### Plot variant frequency by ancestry

You can use the plot function (plot.annotated_vcf) to look at the frequency of these variants across ancestral groups. 

1. Fraction = TRUE returns the fraction of the population with at least 1 of the genes.  
2. Fraction = FALSE returns the average number of variants per person.  
```{r, fig.width = 6.5, fig.height = 4.5}
plot(hcm_vcf, fraction = TRUE)
plot(hcm_vcf, fraction = FALSE)
```

Similar plots can be generated for the un-annotated VCF using a slightly different plot function (plot.plain_vcf). 
```{r, fig.width = 6.5, fig.height = 4.5}
plot(vcf, fraction = FALSE)
```

### Plot Frequency Over Time: freq_over_time(vcf)

`freq_over_time()` works primarily for annotated vcfs. It generates a plot of aggregated allele frequency over time. 
```{r, fig.width = 6.5, fig.height = 4.5}
freq_over_time(hcm_vcf, verbose = FALSE) -> freq
freq
```

### Plot Number of Submissions Over Time for a Gene List: submissions_over_time(genes)

`submissions_over_time()` plots the number of submissions related to any genes in the `genes` parameter over time. 

```{r, fig.width = 6.5, fig.height = 4.5}
submissions_over_time(genes = hcm_panel, verbose = FALSE) -> submits
submits
```
