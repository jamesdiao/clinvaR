#' Compute One-Tailed Beta Distribution Confidence Interval from Observed Alleles
#'
#' This function computes a one-Tailed Beta distribution confidence interval from observed alleles
#' @usage freq_CI(freq, n, cutoff)
#' @param freq numeric; observed frequency
#' @param cutoff numeric; upper tailed confidence range. Default is 95\% = 0.95. 
#' @param n numeric; number of observations, equal to the number of observed alleles 
#' (twice the number of observed individuals). This is hard coded using dataset FAQs for 
#' the aggregateCount() and aggregateCalc() functions
#' @examples freq_CI(freq = 0.05, n = 2*2504, cutoff = 0.95)
#' @export
